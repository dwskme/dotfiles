### This is reuslt of weeks of countless research of countless awesome nvim configs from individual developers to dedicated config creaters. I made this config combining snippets of configs for themes to plugins settings and I donot claim all the settings. The major takeaway i take from this journey of switching to neovim and seraching for a perfect config is there exist no thing such as a perfect settings.
